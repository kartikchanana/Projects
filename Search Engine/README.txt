* The search engine model uses basic stemming techniques to remove irrelevant words and then stores the tokens.
* The query is then fetched from the file 'queries.txt' and results are fetched on the basis of scores calculated using BM25 formula.
* The SEARCH ENGINE has been created in netbeans 7.2, and hence I would advise compiling it through Netbeans.
* No external library has been used.
* The code can be compiled by Java version 7 & and above.
* The main file that has to be executed is "bm25.java" to obtain the results.
* I have already provided the arguments index.out.txt, queries.txt, 100, results.eval.txt in the main function of "bm25.java" class as advised.
* I am including in the zip file, the netbeans project folder that contains the code and the output files, and a readme file.
