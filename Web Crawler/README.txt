****README****

*The Crawler has been created in netbeans 7.2, and hence I would advise compiling it through Netbeans.
*I have used "JSOUP" library downloaded from the 'www.jsoup.org' page.
*To run the project kindly add jsoup.jar(present in the zip file).
*I have attached two word files along '1000 links' and '33 links' that cotain the URL's obtained with non-focused and focused-crawling respectively.
*My code logic finds 33 relevant pages where the word 'cocordance' was found and hence the proportion is 3.3%((33/1000)*100).
*The zip file contains:Project folder(Crawler),the two word files for the URL list,jsoup.jar.
*The code is present at Crawler/src/crawler wherein 'Crawlertest' is the main code to be run.
